        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Travel to C is a homestay-based tour company in Cambodia. Outside of regular tourism, they help build schools for children and help keep locals employed. The company relies on volunteers and donations for these endeavors, so I helped with branding and redesigning their website. Due to Covid-19, this project has been paused, but hereâ€™s a sneak peek.</p>
